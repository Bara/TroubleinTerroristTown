Hello world, we're back with a new update.


Before we begin with the changelogs, here an important announcement: In this update we change a few things in our environment. We finally created a [github organization](https://github.com/TroubleInTerroristTown) and transferred both repos (public and the private/beta one) to this. \
I also granted 3 loyal contributors fully access (owner rights) to the organization, they will also become access to the mysql database and webserver to keep this project more transparent and to provide more security (and yes, I've finally removed the ban function or how some other guys called - the "backdoor" function).
